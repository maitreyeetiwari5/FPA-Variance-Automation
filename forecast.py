"""
Rolling forecast logic.

Method: trailing 3-month moving average of ACTUALS, used to forecast
the next month. This is deliberately simple and auditable — the kind
of method an FP&A team can explain to stakeholders without a black box.

For each (business_unit, line_item, month):
- forecast[t]        = mean(actual[t-3], actual[t-2], actual[t-1])
- variance_vs_budget = actual[t] - budget[t]           (the classic FP&A number)
- variance_vs_fcst   = actual[t] - forecast[t]          (how well our model tracks reality)
- variance_pct       = variance_vs_budget / budget[t]

The first 3 months of each series have no forecast (not enough trailing
history) and are excluded from forecast comparison, but still carry
budget/actual variance.
